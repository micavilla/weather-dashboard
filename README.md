# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This webpage allows users to search and view any city's weather data for the current date and for 5 days forward. Each city the user searches is stored in local storage and once the page is refreshed, displayed in the left-hand list for the user to access its data again upon clicking. Data includes city name, date, temperature, wind, humidity, and an icon representing the weather conditions.
